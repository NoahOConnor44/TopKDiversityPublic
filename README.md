Database Systems Research Paper Programming Implementation


# Requirements:
- Latest version of gcc/g++ (11.2.0 is what we used (done with msys2 for Windows: https://www.msys2.org/)
- C++ 17

# Running the program
- To run the program: './main searchTerm kValue'
- Need to have the folder called datasets that is made up of .txt files for the dataset for it to read through for scoring. 
- metadata files will be made for each query so if its reran its faster and doesnt have to rescore all the documents for that query term.
